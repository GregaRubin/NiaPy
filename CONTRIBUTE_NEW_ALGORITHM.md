# Contributing new nature-inspired algorithms to NiaPy framework

## Introduction

Thank you for taking the time to explore this document. The NiaPy framework has experienced over 5 years of growth, thanks to the helpfulness and willingness of our community contributors. Their significant contributions have played a vital role in the success of this project. While designing and implementing key functions for the main framework is crucial, adding new algorithms is an equally important step in keeping the framework dynamic and up-to-date.

Currently, the NiaPy framework hosts more than 30 algorithms, categorized into three families:

- Basic Algorithms: These are vanilla implementations of nature-inspired algorithms, often derived from research papers where authors propose new algorithms.

- Modified Algorithms: This category includes modified, hybrid, and adaptive variants of basic algorithms.

- Other Algorithms: This encompasses algorithms that fit well under the optimization umbrella but cannot be directly classified into the previously mentioned families (e.g., random search).

For a comprehensive overview of the implemented algorithms, please refer to the [following document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firefly-cpp/NiaPy/master/Algorithms.md).

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the contribution process, ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of optimization algorithms.
- Familiarity with Python and Numpy.
- An understanding of NiaPy's structure and existing algorithms.

We'll delve into the details of the last prerequisite in this document.
